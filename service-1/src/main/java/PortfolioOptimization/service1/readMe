So, this first microservice is a data ingestion microservice.
This service is responsible for fetching data from external APIs (Alpha Vantage and Polygon) and
publishing it to Kafka topics.

So it's very clear that this service doesn't need to persist the data directly to a database.
And that why I have no reason to create DAO or entity classes.
=======================================================================================================================

The second microservice (data processing) is the one that will consume the data from the Kafka topics,
process it, and save it to the DB.
That's where I will need the DAO and entity classes for data persistence.
This service (second microservice: Data Processing) will:

1. Consume the messages from Kafka topics.
2. Transform or process the data if needed.
3. Persist the data into the DB (It can be any database).
=======================================================================================================================

The flow is like -

1- Controller Layer (AlphaVantageController & PolygonController classes) : Entry point of application.

2- Service Layer (AlphaVantageService & PolygonService classes) :
   Handles the core logic.
   Intermediary bw the controller layer and the client layer.
   This layer uses the client classes.

3- Client Layer (AlphaVantageClient & PolygonClient classes): Used by the service layer to fetch the actual data.
   It invokes the client classes to fetch the data, applies any necessary business logic,
   and prepares the data for sending to Kafka.

4- Kafka Producer: After fetching and processing the data, the service layer passes it to the Kafka producer,
   which will publish the data to the appropriate Kafka topics.
   The Kafka producer is the final step in the flow for this microservice.


-------           ---------         ----------            ------------           ----------       ----------       ------

The flow would look something like this:
HTTP Client → Fetches data from external APIs.
Service Layer → Processes the data and decides which Kafka topic to send it to.
Kafka Producer → Publishes the data to a Kafka topic

**
 Also here I am not persisting data to a database and but only processing or passing it through (e.g., writing to Kafka),
 and that is why I do not strictly need entity classes.
 However, it can still be beneficial to use data transfer objects (DTOs) or plain Java objects (POJOs) to represent
 the structure of the data that I am trying to handle.

Not DB specific but using them I can easily define clear data contracts for the kind of messages being sent to or received from Kafka.


** A common question can be - What to use instead of entity classes?
If you're just processing data and not saving it in a database:
Use POJOs or DTOs.

Because these can simply define the structure of the data that we try to handle.

** Another common question is -  When to use entity classes?
Use entity classes only if you're saving or fetching data from a database.
They typically include annotations like @Entity, @Table, and field annotations like @Id.



***** At Last.....

I think minimal DTOs (In simple words: our entity classes without the JPA annotations like @Entity, @Table, @Id, and so on),
like they serve as plain Java objects (POJOs) to hold data, but they are not tied to a database.
And they help us to have a clear structure for the kind of data we want or going to handle.
